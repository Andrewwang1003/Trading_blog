                <p>Recently, I have become much more motivated to make smarter and better trades. I keep overtrading, taking on too much risk, letting emotions control me, and not trusting my analysis. Lately, my trades have been performing better, and I am focusing on taking only the highest-quality setups with stocks that have consistently shown improvement over time.</p>

                <p>I realize there is no point in forcing trades that do not exist and losing money because of impatience. I took positions in RGTI, ARQQ, DFDV, and CRCL, which I considered four-star or higher setups, and all showed solid first-day follow-through. I am hopeful that these positions will continue to perform well, but at this point, all I can do is let the trades play out.</p>

                <p>I have also been more driven to study and review past setups by reading trading books, exploring blogs, and testing different strategies to deepen my understanding of the markets and find the most effective opportunities. I know I could never see myself doing something I do not love. I need to be successful, and this has to work.</p>

                <p>I may have all my eggs in one basket, but I will make sure those eggs do not break. I will do everything I can to study, observe, analyze, ask questions, and learn from every mistake to achieve success in this competitive field. I want to win, and I promise that I will.</p>
