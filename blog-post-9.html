                <p>It is pretty late, and I am writing, but I finally reviewed my trades today, and they were all poor and completely forced. Everything in these markets looked weak, and there were no optimal setups to take, but I decided to overtrade again without much thought.</p>

                <p>I took positions such as LMND, an AI-powered insurance company that showed strong relative strength and had been a leader in this type of play in the past. If there had been a clear setup with solid volume, I would not have minded taking it. However, the setup was weak, with little consolidation, and the entire idea was based on a weekly chart that was flawed from the start. This trade was forced, and that was my fault. I need to keep myself more accountable.</p>

                <p>Next, I took PRCH because Nick, my trading mentor and friend, tagged me to trade it. I entered with a 0.5% risk. This setup was also weak, but since Nick took it, I convinced myself that I should take it too. I ended up getting stopped out. I need to focus on my own conviction and trade the setups I believe in instead of jumping into trades just because others do.</p>

                <p>Then I took COIN, which was easily the worst trade of the day. There was no valid setup. The stock had already broken out three days ago and was heavily extended. Looking back, I have no idea why I entered that trade. I was running on very little sleep, and I took a series of bad positions. There might be a connection there, so I need to make sure I get enough rest before trading. When I am tired, I lose focus and make careless decisions.</p>

                <p>My account is now at $8.9k, which is under $9k, meaning I will switch back to paper trading for now. Still, I want to rebuild my confidence by taking smaller but more promising trades. If I see a five-star setup, such as MVST on 4/17, GRPN on 5/27, PGY on 5/22, BBAI on 6/24, or PARR on 6/10, I will take it with only 0.25% risk per trade, or about $25.</p>

                <p>This will help me stay disciplined while proving that I can be profitable again. Once I achieve a 20-30% win rate with an average return of 1:8 on my winners, I will return to full cash trading. That structure will make profitability achievable. I just need to stay patient, control my emotions, and wait for the highest-quality setups.</p>
