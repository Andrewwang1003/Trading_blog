                <p>I have not written much in this journal lately. The last few days have been alright, and overall, my account has been moving up, peaking around $9.25k, which I am satisfied with. I have been trading much less because I have not had the time, and I have also been sick for the last three days.</p>

                <p>During that time, I conducted more research to identify the main reason behind my recent downturn, and I found that the problem is overtrading. I have been taking almost every setup I see, regardless of whether it is a weak setup or in an unproductive sector. I need to spend more time identifying the strongest and most promising setups.</p>

                <p>I am referring to momentum leaders that show consistent strength and stability. I need to trade more like Nick, my mentor, instead of following my own impulsive habits. Nick only takes one or two trades a week, while I take two or three a day. I need to be more patient and let my money sit until the right opportunity comes.</p>

                <p>Overtrading will hold me back, and if I want to take trading seriously, I must pay closer attention to what successful traders do and learn from them. I keep imagining myself reaching the top and becoming the best trader I can be, yet I still struggle with profitability.</p>

                <p>To change that, I need to trade less and think more. I should only take the best trades with the best setups, in the strongest sectors, during optimal conditions, and always follow the momentum leaders. Patience and precision will separate me from my past mistakes.</p>
