                <p>My portfolio has been sitting around the same level lately, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. For the first time, I feel like I am becoming more patient and deliberate with every trade I take. I have been trading less, but the trades I do take have been stronger and better thought out.</p>

                <p>BE has been carrying my portfolio and keeping it steady, helping me stay above water despite a few small losses here and there. Those small losses add up over time—almost like death by a thousand paper cuts, but they are teaching me something valuable. Each minor setback reminds me that I need to wait for quality setups and focus on bigger, more meaningful trades instead of forcing smaller ones out of impatience.</p>

                <p>I am learning that patience truly pays off. Instead of chasing every breakout or reacting to every move, I am starting to recognize when to sit still and let the market come to me. That restraint has been difficult, but it is what separates random trading from consistent execution.</p>

                <p>If I can continue to stay calm and disciplined, I know my results will follow. Agastya is still working on finishing the superperformance analysis project, though he ran into some issues with our API key, which slowed progress down. I still want to keep the project moving forward because I know it will be a big step in improving how I study these past market leaders.</p>

                <p>Even though school and college applications are picking up, I am trying to manage my time and stay consistent with everything. I feel like I am slowly starting to understand what makes a good trader. It is not about constant action but about consistent focus.</p>

                <p>I just need to keep this mindset, stay patient, and let discipline become second nature. That is how I will grow; not through luck or emotion, but through persistence and control.</p>
