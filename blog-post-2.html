                <p>It has been a while since I last checked in, but my positions have been slowly grinding up, and I am starting to see real progress again. I have learned that the key to making money is not constant trading, but giving my positions time to work. The longer I hold quality setups, the more clearly I can see how patience pays off.</p>

                <p>I used to think that trading more meant improving faster, but now I understand that taking fewer, higher-quality trades is what really moves the needle. I am almost back to break-even and feeling more comfortable in the markets than I have in a long time. I am beginning to take on slightly more risk when the opportunity is right, but it feels controlled and calculated rather than impulsive.</p>

                <p>Positions like BE, NUGT, TEM, and KTOS have been carrying my account, each one slowly pushing my portfolio higher. Watching them grind upward day after day reinforces what I have been trying to learn for months—discipline and patience always win over overtrading.</p>

                <p>All side projects, including the superperformance analysis, are paused for now as college applications take priority. Even with everything going on, I still feel focused on trading and confident that I am finally building the habits that will carry me long-term. Slow progress is still progress, and I am learning to trust that.</p>
