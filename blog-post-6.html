                <p>Hey guys, long time no see. I have been locked in for the last couple of days and am finally experiencing smaller wins. The account is sitting around 9.2K, with most of my positions where I can't lose any more money. I have been more disciplined in trying to take fewer extended names, limiting myself to only the strongest setups.</p>

                <p>I've spoken to many people in the Quallamaggie Discord, and I believe I need to study more setups and take more notes. I want to watch more of Quallamaggie's YouTube videos that discuss how to find the best setups, and I want to focus solely on setups. Even though earning seasons are soon approaching, which means there will be a lot of EPs, I still don't want to take on as much as I haven't mastered and fully understood the setup to its fullest extent.</p>

                <p>I want to master breakouts, Ema bounces, fishhook, and more strategies one at a time, slowly growing my knowledge of older charts and overall improving what I know to make sure that I can have the highest chances of a winning trade.</p>

                <p>To enhance my understanding of setups, I've determined that I want to go back in time and track the strongest growing stocks in the entire stock market. This is kind of a rough idea of what I'm looking for: I want to track the explosive stock growth of the strongest stocks in the stock market. The stock must have an average daily volume of over 200k shares traded daily, and it has to be part of the NYSE or NASDAQ.</p>

                <p>For what I count as explosive growth is a stock moving 100%+ in 3 - 12 months, along with a stock moving 150%+ in 12 - 24months. Suppose the stock grows by 300% or more in under 12 months or 1000% or more in under 24 months; that is called superperformance. If there is a 20% in the middle of that time frame, I would also take a note that says drawdown.</p>

                <p>I determine growth by the first date it starts, how much it grows to the last date, and the percentage that the stock moves by. For example, if Nvidia stock were at $100 in December 2020 and became $200 in May 2021, that would be considered a growth stock, as it increased by 100% in the 3-12 month range. Still, it is not a super-performing stock.</p>

                <p>I should get a result that shows the ticker name plus the time frame, indicating whether it is a super-performing stock. For the NVDA example, it should display NVDA, Dec 23, 2020 - May 5, 2021, Not SP. My friend Agastya will code this using an API and upload the data into a spreadsheet, which I can then use to look back in time and examine the intraday and daily candles for these moves up. With this, I can create a more potent edge that will help me identify these breakouts more effectively. Hopefully this can be coded soon.</p>
