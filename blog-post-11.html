                <p>I feel frustrated with trading. I feel like I took a trade, and I just chopped around, and prices don't move once I enter. It's a mix of my fault along with unlucky price action. I struggle with FOMO, and I need to pay attention to the best trades and take those instead of jumping at everything I see.</p>

                <p>I need to examine the stock, research it, determine if it is a leader, assess its potential upside, check its relative strength, and analyze its past price action before making a decision. I need to limit myself to names I have heard of or others have mentioned as well. Tomorrow, my goal is to take better trades. There is no point in studying these stocks for hours on end if I don't use that research when I trade.</p>

                <p>I feel like when I take a trade, there's always something better, and I wish I had taken that one if I had more conviction. However, I rush into positions and need to think more. Stocks like NBIS, CRCL, OKLO, SMR, and others have been moving up strong, but I end up taking a weaker setup that just chops around. Then I get stopped out the next day for a loss of $50 or $100, and those paper cuts start to hurt after a while.</p>

                <p>I have been taking loss after loss, and I feel like I can't catch a break. Yesterday, on June 23, I felt like I finally caught one, but the next day I lost a significant portion of the money I had just made, took a new position that failed, and overall, I was chopped up or lost money to the downside. Meanwhile, trades that slipped past my notice, such as BBAI, ran without me.</p>

                <p>I took NBIS, which moved up and then chopped around, and it is now sitting only slightly above my entry. I need to follow my basic rules. AISP did not have strength after the gap up, but I still took it when I shouldn't have. Next time, I need to stop trading when I feel uncertain. I tell myself this day after day, but I just don't listen.</p>

                <p>I need to lock in if I want to do this in the future and stop letting myself repeat these same mistakes. I need to stop being frustrated; my emotions are getting the better of me. I need to relax, follow my rules, and trust my convictions. I need to stop rushing into trades and think carefully before acting. Overtrading and FOMO will be my downfall if I do not control them.</p>

                <p>I promise I will be profitable by the end of the summer. If my account reaches $9,000, I will revert to paper trading until I become consistently profitable. I need to relax and focus. I will lock in, I promise. I want to do this for the rest of my life. I need to focus and ignore the noise. I just need to stay calm and take smarter positions that focus on momentum leaders rather than random setups.</p>

                <p>My current positions—NBIS, RKLB, TSLA, and GRPN—are all strong, and I just need to focus on the upside and maintain my confidence. Small wins before the big ones. Day by day, I'll climb back into break-even and then into profit. Staying calm and disciplined will get me there. I know I can do it as long as I focus and stay consistent.</p>
