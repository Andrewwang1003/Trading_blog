                <p>The last few weeks have been hectic with college applications, so I have not had much time to study the markets or track every setup like I usually do. Even though I have been busy, I have still managed to trade and make decisions when opportunities appeared. My understanding of market structure and timing has improved, and I feel more confident in my ability to act decisively when needed.</p>

                <p>Today, I decided to sell several of my positions after hearing news about Trump threatening tariffs, which caused some uncertainty across the market. Rather than risk giving back profits, I closed positions like UMAC, KTOS, and NUGT, all of which had been strong contributors to my account's recent growth. This was a tough call because these names had been performing well, but I am learning that protecting capital is just as important as growing it.</p>

                <p>Selling strength is never easy, but sometimes it is the most rational choice. I am trying to stay consistent and avoid letting greed take control. Even though I sold some of my better-performing positions, others such as RKLB and UAMY have continued to show strong relative strength and have been pushing higher. Watching them hold their levels despite market weakness gives me confidence that my selection process is improving.</p>

                <p>My account is currently around $12K, which puts me roughly 20% above the market, and that feels like a major milestone. It is proof that the work I have been putting in is paying off. I can see now that mastering my emotions is the final piece of the puzzle. When I trade calmly, I make smarter decisions.</p>

                <p>I know I still have a long way to go, but moments like this remind me that I can make trading work for me if I keep building discipline, staying patient, and continuing to grow step by step.</p>
