                <p>Today was rough. My account is sitting around $8.6K, and I keep losing again and again. I tell myself to slow down and take only the best setups, but when the market opens, I lose patience and start forcing trades that are not there. I end up taking weak entries with little conviction, getting stopped out, and then watching the move play out without me.</p>

                <p>It is frustrating because I know exactly what I am doing wrong. I am overtrading, chasing moves, and letting emotion control my decisions. The losses hurt not just because of the money, but because I know I could have avoided them by following my plan.</p>

                <p>Still, I am learning. Each mistake is showing me how important patience and selectivity are. Trading well means trading less, focusing only on high-quality setups during the right market conditions. I can feel myself getting a little better at recognizing when not to trade, which is progress in itself.</p>

                <p>One strong, disciplined trade can make up for many small losses, but I need to earn that discipline first. Agastya is still working on finishing the superperformance analysis project, but I am unsure how much time I can dedicate to it right now. College applications are coming up soon, and school is starting to get busy again.</p>

                <p>Balancing everything will be hard, but I still want to keep learning when I can. I just need to slow down, stay patient, and trade smarter. The improvement will come.</p>
