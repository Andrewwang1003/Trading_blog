                <p>Recently, my trades have been alright. All the positions I took were technically sound and had a decent conviction; however, they lacked significant momentum behind them. There is a possibility I'm trying to chase the dream set up, the ones I have been watching and keeping track of. The ones I have been missing and wishing I had gotten into.</p>

                <p>Because of this constant chase, I might be overtrading on chasing that setup, and instead, not focusing on the solid ones. IONQ, NBIS, RDDT, and MSTR were good trades today. Although there wasn't any strong follow-through on NBIS, it looked promising. The rest had follow-through but stopped me out on the way, or didn't have a picture perfect entry.</p>

                <p>I think that I should take stuff only based on a 5-minute high to raise my conviction and limit the amount of risk I would be taking. That would have stopped me from taking NBIS. I just got stopped out of RDDT, and then it started pushing higher; there's not much I can do about that. IONQ had a weak opening, resulting in a reasonably high risk compared to the reward. I'm keeping IONQ as I like the name, and it has a good history of follow-through.</p>

                <p>One thing that I'm very frustrated with is MSTR. I took this off a 5-minute high retake, which started strong but was extremely choppy. After I was up a little bit, it faded back into my entry, and all my positions seemed weak at the time, so I just decided to get rid of the position. However, afterward, it pushed higher than before, pushing 1RR above my entry, causing me to miss out on some serious gains.</p>

                <p>At least I didn't lose the positions, which could have been a very realistic outcome. This is another reminder for me to follow my trading rules and stick to my stop-losses and take-profits. There is no reason to overdo it and try different strategies in hopes of avoiding a slight loss.</p>

                <p>Overall, I realized from this trading day to keep myself in check and trust my stop losses. Ideally, after 7:30, I should be off my computer and minding my own business, and check back into my positions before the market closes. When I spend too much time on my laptop, I tend to overthink and end up doing something I regret. I just need to stay calm and relax.</p>

                <p>My conviction today was good, but the market-moving money just wasn't there, and that's okay. Tomorrow will be another trading day with a decent amount of funds, so I should be able to take some good-sized and leveraged positions. It only takes me 2-3 good trades with 1:15 RR for me to come back and make up for all my losses.</p>

                <p>Keep in mind I have only been trading with real money for a month and have been trading for only 7 months, so I have a lot of time to learn and perfect my strategy. No one said trading would be easy, as it's a tough and extremely mentally challenging endeavor. It's okay, though. I'm building a skill and starting early, which I'll have 5 years to practice and work on before I enter the real world. I have time, and I promise to be profitable. Perfection takes time, and that's all I have.</p>
