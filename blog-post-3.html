                <p>Lately, I feel like I am slowly starting to get it. My patience has improved, and I am learning to size into larger positions on the stocks that truly lead the market. The momentum names are where the real money is made, and I am beginning to understand how to identify and commit to them with confidence.</p>

                <p>NUGT and BE have been my bigger winners recently, both showing clean strength and steady follow-through. Smaller names like RCAT and SOFI have also added to the progress, but I can see clearly now that the big gains come from the true leaders. It feels good to finally let the market work in my favor instead of trying to force something that is not there.</p>

                <p>I have been focusing on patience more than ever. Instead of jumping into trades too early, I am letting my positions slowly grind up, giving them the time and space they need to develop. That change in mindset has made a huge difference. I am no longer rushing into mediocre setups just to feel active.</p>

                <p>I have also started paying much more attention to my entries, waiting for the perfect moment instead of settling for a setup that looks "good enough." Every time I avoid a bad entry, I save myself unnecessary losses, and that discipline is starting to show in my account.</p>

                <p>Agastya and I decided to pause the superperformance project for now. With school and other responsibilities stacking up, it makes more sense to return to it later when we both have the time and energy to do it right. Even though progress has slowed on that front, I am still growing in my trading.</p>

                <p>Each day, I feel a little closer to understanding what consistent success requires. The key is patience, precision, and the willingness to sit tight when others panic. I am starting to trust that process.</p>
